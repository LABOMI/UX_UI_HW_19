            <h>About Me</h>
            <p>With a background in an exhibition industry, my role in each always involves the project managing,
                    supervising, and working with skateholder. By taking a responsibilites of my role, I was able to solve
                    the urgent problems, work detaily, collaborate with different departments and communicate between two
                    companies.
                    As a UX Desiger, I am able to leverage my background in project managing, solving problems and working
                    with skateholder. I can prioritize client needs and solve the problems in a user-centered way. My
                    process entail creating target users, doing interviews with target users and get an insight from the
                    interview results. Afterthen Identify users’ painpoint and needs. Using heuristic analysis, card
                    sorting, site map and user flow make sure whether it’s being made easier and friendly for people to use.
                    Also, by doing a multiple usertesting and prototype iteration improve the users’ experience. </p>
            <h>Stay Humble</h>
            <p>I consider my self a humble person. By staying humble I can pay attention to what other people saying
                    and thingking. It can also mean, I am open to the feedback. As a ux designer it is important to listen
                    honest and directed feedback. Receiving other people’s feedback can broaden my thingking and it can help
                    to develop my problem solving skills. </p>
